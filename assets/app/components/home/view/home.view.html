<div class="container">
  <p><b>Develop an elevator system with a web frontend and backend storage system</b></p>
  <p>- The gui should cater for 4 elevators (numbered A,B,C and D) and 10 floors.</p>
  <p>- Each elevator should not take on more than 20 people at a time.</p>
  <p>- People on a certain floor (for example, Level 9) should get the nearest available elevator
(eg, say 3 elevators {A,B,C} are on floor 1 and the fourth {D} is on level 10 then elevator D should travel to get the people on level 9)</p>
  <p>- The gui should show each level and the number of people who wish to enter an elevator (textbox)</p>
  <p>- Each level should have dropdown menu and button beside it to represent the level / floor that the people on the said level wish to travel to</p>
  <p>- On each level there should be another 4 columns which show each elevator status.
That is, the number of people in the current elevator and whether itâ€™s going up (^) down (\/) or stationary (-)</p>
  <p>- The movement of the elevators tracked / stored in backend data storage of your choice.</p>
  <p>- The solution should be able to be built / compiled and then run without setup / configuration adjustments by the examiner.</p>
  <p>- The solution should be very well documented.</p>
